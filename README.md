# Firefox_Decrypt_ASN.1-Delphi

A Delphi-based utility for recovering stored passwords from Firefox profiles. This tool can decrypt passwords stored in Firefox's password manager using the browser's built-in encryption mechanisms.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

This tool is intended for **legitimate password recovery purposes only**, such as:
- Recovering your own forgotten passwords
- Data migration between browsers
- Personal security auditing

Please ensure you have the legal right to access any passwords you attempt to decrypt.

## Features

- Supports multiple Firefox profiles
- Handles both older and newer Firefox encryption schemes
- Multiple output formats:
  - Human-readable text
  - JSON
  - CSV
- Automatic profile detection
- Cross-platform compatible (Windows)

## Technical Details

The tool implements Firefox's password encryption scheme, including:
- ASN.1 structure parsing
- 3DES and AES-256 decryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation
- NSS (Network Security Services) master key extraction
- Support for key4.db databases

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Firefox profile with saved passwords
- Delphi development environment (if building from source)
- sqlite DLL (include)
- Required Delphi components:
  - UniDAC (for SQLite database access)
  - DEC (Delphi Encryption Components)

## Usage

```bash
FirefoxDecrypt.exe [options]

Options:
  -f, --format FORMAT   Output format (human, json, csv)
  -l, --list           List available profiles
  -c, --choice NUMBER  Profile to use (starts with 1)
  -h, --help          Show this help message
```

### Examples

List available profiles:
```bash
FirefoxDecrypt.exe --list
```

Decrypt passwords from specific profile:
```bash
FirefoxDecrypt.exe --choice 1
```

Export as JSON:
```bash
FirefoxDecrypt.exe --format json
```

## Building from Source

1. Ensure you have Delphi installed with UniDAC and DEC components
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project in Delphi IDE
4. Build the project using the IDE or command line

## Project Structure

- `FirefoxDecrypt.dpr`: Main program file
- `Unit1.pas`: Core decryption logic and helpers
- Supporting units for:
  - ASN.1 parsing
  - Encryption/Decryption
  - Firefox profile management
  - Data output formatting

## How it Works

1. Locates Firefox profiles on the system
2. Extracts the master key from key4.db
3. Reads encrypted passwords from logins.json
4. Decrypts individual entries using:
   - Global salt from key4.db
   - Master key derived from metadata
   - Individual encryption keys for each entry
